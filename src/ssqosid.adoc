== Quality-of-Service (QoS) Identifiers

== Introduction
Quality of Service (QoS) is defined as the minimal end-to-end performance
guaranteed in advance by a service level agreement (SLA) to a workload.
Performance metrics might include measures such as instructions per cycle (IPC),
latency of service, etc.

When multiple workloads execute concurrently on modern processors—equipped with
large core counts, multiple cache hierarchies, and multiple memory
controllers—the performance of any given workload becomes less deterministic, or
even non-deterministic, due to shared resource contention cite:[PTCAMP].

To manage performance variability, system software needs resource allocation and
monitoring capabilities. These capabilities allow for the reservation of
resources like cache and bandwidth, thus meeting individual performance targets
while minimizing interference cite:[HERACLES]. For resource management, hardware
should provide monitoring features that allow system software to profile
workload resource consumption and allocate resources accordingly.

To facilitate this, the QoS Identifiers extension (Ssqosid) introduces the
`srmcfg` register, which configures a hart with two identifiers: a Resource
Control ID (`RCID`) and a Monitoring Counter ID (`MCID`). These identifiers
accompany each request issued by the hart to shared resource controllers.

Additional metadata, like the nature of the memory access and the ID of the
originating supervisor domain, can accompany `RCID` and `MCID`. Resource
controllers may use this metadata for differentiated service such as a different
capacity allocation for code storage vs. data storage. Resource controllers can
use this data for security policies such as not exposing statistics of one
security domain to another.

These identifiers are crucial for the proposed RISC-V Capacity and Bandwidth
Controller QoS Register Interface cite:[CBQRI], which provides methods for
setting resource usage limits and monitoring resource consumption. The `RCID`
controls resource allocations, while the `MCID` is used for tracking resource
usage.

== The Quality-of-Service (QoS) Identifiers

The `srmcfg` register is an SXLEN-bit read/write register used to configure a
Resource Control ID (`RCID`) and a Monitoring Counter ID (`MCID`). Both `RCID`
and `MCID` are WARL fields. The register is formatted as shown in <<SRMCFG64>>
when SXLEN=64 and <<SRMCFG32>> when SXLEN=32. The CSR number is 0x181.

The `RCID` and `MCID` accompany each request made by the hart to shared resource
controllers. The `RCID` is used to determine the resource allocations
(e.g., cache occupancy limits, memory bandwidth limits, etc.) to enforce. The
`MCID` is used to identify a counter to monitor resource usage.

  {bits: 12, name: 'MCID'},
  {bits:  4, name: 'WPRI'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `RCID` and `MCID` configured in the `srmcfg` CSR apply to all privilege
modes cite:[PRIV] of software execution on that hart by default, but this
behavior may be overridden by future extensions.

If extension Smstateen is implemented together with Ssqosid, then Ssqosid also
requires the bit 55 in `mstateen0` introduced by Priv 1.14 to be implemented. If
bit 55 of `mstateen0` is 0, attempts to access `srmcfg` in privilege modes less
privileged than M-mode raise an illegal-instruction exception. If bit 55 of
`mstateen0` is 1 or if extension Smstateen is not implemented, attempts to
access `srmcfg` when `V=1` raise a virtual-instruction exception.

[NOTE]
====
A reset value of 0 is suggested for the `RCID` field matching resource
controllers' default behavior of associating all capacity with `RCID=0`. The
`MCID` reset value does not affect functionality and may be
implementation-defined.

Typically, fewer bits are allocated for `RCID` (e.g., to support tens of RCIDs)
than for `MCID` (e.g., to support hundreds of MCIDs). A common `RCID` is usually
used to group apps or VMs, pooling resource allocations to meet collective SLAs.
If an SLA breach occurs, unique MCIDs enable granular monitoring, aiding
decisions on resource adjustment, associating a different `RCID` with a subset
of members, or migrating members to other machines. The larger pool of MCIDs
speeds up this analysis.

The `RCID` and `MCID` in `srmcfg` apply across all privilege levels on the hart.
Typically, higher-privilege modes don't modify `srmcfg`, as they often serve
lower-privileged tasks. If differentiation is needed, higher privilege code can
update `srmcfg` and restore it before returning to a lower privilege level.

[NOTE]
====

In VM environments, hypervisors usually manage resource allocations, keeping
the Guest OS out of QoS flows. If needed, the hypervisor can virtualize
`srmcfg` CSR for a VM using the virtual-instruction exceptions triggered upon
Guest access. If the direct selection of `RCID` and `MCID` by the VM becomes
common and emulation overhead is an issue, future extensions may allow VS-mode
to use a selector for a hypervisor-configured set of CSRs holding `RCID` and
`MCID` values designated for that Guest OS use.

During context switches, the supervisor may choose to execute with the `srmcfg`
of the outgoing context to attribute the execution to it. Prior to restoring
the new context, it switches to the new VM's `srmcfg`. The supervisor can also
use a separate configuration for execution not to be attributed to either
contexts.
